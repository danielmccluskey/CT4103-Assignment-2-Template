Your report document submission will be submitted online via Moodle. The Maximum file size for uploading is 100MB. 

While Moodle does not require a set naming convention for any files uploaded, please ensure your submission is given a meaningful file name, with no special characters (e.g. commas, speech marks, question marks, etc.).
